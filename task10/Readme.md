# Task 10 | Semantic Image Search in Elastic







## About Task: 
The goal of this task is to implement a semantic image search system using Elasticsearch and kNN algorithms. This task will guide you through setting up an image similarity search, where users can search for images based on text descriptions or find visually similar images by uploading an image.

## Which tools will use:
* [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?plcmt=nav&pg=nav&tech=rpt&cta=eswt-b):  For indexing and searching image embeddings. Use 14-day free trial.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3919/): For generating image embeddings using the CLIP model.
* [Github](https://gist.github.com/berkorbay/6feda478a00b0432d13f1fc0a50467f1): To clone source repo.

## Project steps:

#### 1. Set up the necessary environment
* Install Python, github and dataset. 

#### 2. Download the source Github repo
```git clone https://github.com/radoondas/flask-elastic-image-search.git ```

#### 3. Create Elastic Cloud Account
* Machine Learning features requires subscribtion. Use 14-day free trial.

#### 4. Generate image embeddigns
* Upload NLP model we need to generate image embeddings from our dataset. 

#### 5. Building the Frontend with Flask Test the results

* Run Flask application and check by send some request 

## Delivery:
- Provide a Flask application which working like below;
