# Elasticsearch Task 1 

## Area to Work:

- Install Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Elastic Agent on Linux.

## Task:

- You will be provided with Nginx Access and Error Logs, extract and parse the logs based on their file types, and index the Nginx logs into Elasticsearch through the Elastic Agent Integration. If there are any uncertainties about your expectations, please review the architecture in the link below.

#### Link: https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/nginx

- Display Nginx logs in Kibana with ready-made Dashboards.

## Delivery:

- Create a role and assign a user to this role.

- Grant access to Dashboard and Discover in terms of accessibility.

#### Note : We do not want the assigned user to have access to everything, we only want them to be able to read logs in Kibana.

## Questions:

- Were you able to create a role and assign a user?

- Were you able to obtain the requested visuals?

- When comparing the documentation counts for Nginx Access and Error Logs, did you obtain equal results?
