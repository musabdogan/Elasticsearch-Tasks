# Elasticsearch Task 1 

## Area of Work:

Install Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Elastic Agent on Linux.

## Task:

Nginx Access and Error logs will be provided to you. Extract the logs based on their file types, and send the logs to Elasticsearch using Elastic Agent Integration. An example configuration for the Integration is as follows:

Nginx Access Logs: /path/to/log

Nginx Error Logs: /path/to/log

Full Example: /home/node1/Downloads/access.log

Display Nginx logs with ready-made dashboards in Kibana.

## Delivery:

Create a role and assign a user to this role.
Note: We do not want the assigned user to have access to everything; we only want them to be able to read logs in Kibana.
